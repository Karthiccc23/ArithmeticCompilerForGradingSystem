# CompilerForGradingSystem

A compiler that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that a computer's processor uses.
•	 I have developed a student grading program compiler using Python in Python 3.8 IDE.  
•	The program will use a python dictionary, which will consist of student names, assignments scores, test scores, and lab scores. 
•	Four test marks will be included for each student and average of a student will be calculated.
•	The program will be made up of five functions getAverage, calculateTotalAverage, and assignLetterGrade. 
•	getAverage function will compute the average. 
•	calculateTotalAverage function calculates average scores for assignments scores, lab scores, and test scores.
•	 Function assignLetterGrade will determine the final grade for every student in the dictionaries.
